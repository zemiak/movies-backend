On the eastern continent, the dispossessed Princess Daenerys Targaryen marries Khal Drogo, a warlord of the Dothraki with tens of thousands of warriors at his command. Her brother, Viserys, callously plans to win Drogo's allegiance with the marriage, so that he may return home to Westeros and reclaim the Iron Throne, which was seized by force from his father by Robert. In the frozen lands, beyond the Wall, the wildlings are on the move to the alarm of the Night's Watch. But something else is stirring even further north.","descriptionEmpty":false,"displayOrder":101,"emptySerie":false,"fileName":"201405/S101.m4v","genre":{"displayOrder":2,"empty":false,"id":4,"name":"SF-Fantasy","pictureFileName":"sf.png"},"genreName":"SF-Fantasy","id":9961,"language":{"displayOrder":3,"id":"cz","name":"Czech","none":false},"languageName":"Czech","name":"Winter Is Coming","originalLanguage":{"displayOrder":1,"id":"en","name":"English","none":false},"originalLanguageName":"English","originalName":"","pictureFileName":"S101.jpg","serie":{"displayOrder":1000,"empty":false,"genre":{"displayOrder":2,"empty":false,"id":4,"name":"SF-Fantasy","pictureFileName":"sf.png"},"genreName":"SF-Fantasy","id":1000,"name":"Game of Thrones","pictureFileName":"got.jpg","tvShow":true},"serieName":"Game of Thrones","subtitles":{"displayOrder":3,"id":"cz","name":"Czech","none":false},"subtitlesName":"Czech","url":"","urlEmpty":true,"urlFlag":""}
