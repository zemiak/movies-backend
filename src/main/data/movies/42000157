Melisandre tries to seduce Snow in an attempt to convince him to go to Winterfell with Stannis. In Winterfell, Baelish prepares to return to King's Landing. Before leaving, he tries to dispel Sansa's misgivings towards Ramsay, telling her that even if Stannis does not defeat the Boltons and rescue her, she can easily manipulate Ramsay. Bronn and Jaime land secretly in Dorne; they encounter and kill four horsemen. The Sand Snakes learn from a sea captain that Jaime has come to Dorne for Myrcella; Ellaria convinces the Sand Snakes to plan to avenge the death of Oberyn by abducting Myrcella before Jaime can intervene. Mormont plans to redeem himself to Targaryen by giving Tyrion to her as a prisoner. In Meereen, Loraq makes another appeal to her to reopen the fighting pits; the Sons of the Harpy ambush an Unsullied patrol inside the citadel; Grey Worm is critically wounded and Selmy is killed.","descriptionEmpty":false,"displayOrder":504,"emptySerie":false,"fileName":"201605/S05E04 Sons of the Harpy.m4v","genre":{"displayOrder":2,"empty":false,"id":4,"name":"SF-Fantasy","pictureFileName":"sf.png"},"genreName":"SF-Fantasy","id":42000157,"language":{"displayOrder":3,"id":"cz","name":"Czech","none":false},"languageName":"Czech","name":"Sons of the Harpy","originalLanguage":{"displayOrder":1,"id":"en","name":"English","none":false},"originalLanguageName":"English","originalName":"Sons of the Harpy","pictureFileName":"S05E04 Sons of the Harpy.jpg","serie":{"displayOrder":1000,"empty":false,"genre":{"displayOrder":2,"empty":false,"id":4,"name":"SF-Fantasy","pictureFileName":"sf.png"},"genreName":"SF-Fantasy","id":1000,"name":"Game of Thrones","pictureFileName":"got.jpg","tvShow":true},"serieName":"Game of Thrones","subtitles":{"displayOrder":3,"id":"cz","name":"Czech","none":false},"subtitlesName":"Czech","url":"http://www.csfd.cz/film/263138-hra-o-truny/417536-synove-harpyje/","urlEmpty":false,"urlFlag":"CSFD","year":2015}
