Sending Seaworth to the Wall to ask for supplies, Stannis reluctantly decides to sacrifice Shireen, burning her alive at the stake, while she desperately cries out for her parents. Snow and the others return to the Wall, allowing the wildlings to pass South. In Dorne, Doran permits Jaime and Bronn to return to King's Landing with Myrcella, provided Trystane accompany them and serve on the small council in Oberyn's stead. The former also pardons Sand and her daughters. In Braavos, Arya spots Trant accompanying Mace, Margaery's father and the Master of Coin. In Meereen, the fights at Daznak's pit begin, and Targaryen is stunned to see Mormont amongst the combatants. His triumph is interrupted by a fierce attack by the Sons of the Harpy, who quickly surround Targaryen and her supporters, including Mormont. Just as all hope seems lost, Drogon arrives, and she mounts it and flies away from the pit, her followers watching in awe.","descriptionEmpty":false,"displayOrder":509,"emptySerie":false,"fileName":"201605/S05E09 The Dance of Dragons.m4v","genre":{"displayOrder":2,"empty":false,"id":4,"name":"SF-Fantasy","pictureFileName":"sf.png"},"genreName":"SF-Fantasy","id":42000151,"language":{"displayOrder":3,"id":"cz","name":"Czech","none":false},"languageName":"Czech","name":"The Dance of Dragons","originalLanguage":{"displayOrder":1,"id":"en","name":"English","none":false},"originalLanguageName":"English","originalName":"The Dance of Dragons","pictureFileName":"S05E09 The Dance of Dragons.jpg","serie":{"displayOrder":1000,"empty":false,"genre":{"displayOrder":2,"empty":false,"id":4,"name":"SF-Fantasy","pictureFileName":"sf.png"},"genreName":"SF-Fantasy","id":1000,"name":"Game of Thrones","pictureFileName":"got.jpg","tvShow":true},"serieName":"Game of Thrones","subtitles":{"displayOrder":3,"id":"cz","name":"Czech","none":false},"subtitlesName":"Czech","url":"http://www.csfd.cz/film/263138-hra-o-truny/417541-tanec-draku/","urlEmpty":false,"urlFlag":"CSFD","year":2015}
