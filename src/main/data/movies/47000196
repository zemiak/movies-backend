Against Tyrion's advice, Daenerys has Drogon burn Randyll and Dickon Tarly alive for remaining allegiant to Cersei, forcing the other captives to pledge fealty to the former. Jorah arrives at Dragonstone and reunites with Daenerys. Maester Wolkan alerts Jon and the Citadel about the approaching wights to the Eastwatch by the Sea. Jon decides to travel beyond the Wall and capture a wight in order to convince Cersei for a temporary alliance. Davos smuggles Tyrion inside King's Landing, where he secretly meets with Jaime and offers an armistice, which Cersei accepts, informing Jaime that she is pregnant. Davos rendezvouses with Gendry and returns him to Dragonstone. With the Citadel ignoring Wolkan's letter, Samwell steals several books and leaves with Gilly and Little Sam. At Winterfell, Littlefinger notices Arya spying on him and leads her to take a letter written by Sansa from his room. Jon, Jorah, and Gendry, joined by the Hound, the Brotherhood, and a group of the Free Folk led by Tormund, leave Eastwatch and pass the Wall, intending to capture a wight as evidence for Cersei that the Army of the Dead is real.","descriptionEmpty":false,"displayOrder":705,"emptySerie":false,"fileName":"201712/s07e05 Eastwatch.m4v","genre":{"displayOrder":2,"empty":false,"id":4,"name":"SF-Fantasy","pictureFileName":"sf.png"},"genreName":"SF-Fantasy","id":47000196,"language":{"displayOrder":3,"id":"cz","name":"Czech","none":false},"languageName":"Czech","name":"Eastwatch","originalLanguage":{"displayOrder":1,"id":"en","name":"English","none":false},"originalLanguageName":"English","originalName":"Eastwatch","pictureFileName":"s07e05 Eastwatch.jpg","serie":{"displayOrder":1000,"empty":false,"genre":{"displayOrder":2,"empty":false,"id":4,"name":"SF-Fantasy","pictureFileName":"sf.png"},"genreName":"SF-Fantasy","id":1000,"name":"Game of Thrones","pictureFileName":"got.jpg","tvShow":true},"serieName":"Game of Thrones","subtitles":{"displayOrder":3,"id":"cz","name":"Czech","none":false},"subtitlesName":"Czech","url":"","urlEmpty":true,"urlFlag":"","year":2017}
