Cersei demands Jon's neutrality in the Great War, but he upholds his oath to Daenerys, provoking Cersei to leave. Tyrion meets privately with Cersei, apparently persuading her to ally. Cersei later reveals to Jaime that she was lying and instead intends to use the Golden Company of Braavos to secure her hold on Westeros. Disgusted, Jaime deserts her and rides north. Bound for White Harbor, Jon and Daenerys make love. At Dragonstone, Theon earns the respect of his men and leads them to rescue Yara. At Winterfell, Littlefinger sows dissent using Arya's threatening demeanor with Sansa, who assembles a trial. After listing Littlefinger's acts of treason against House Stark and the North, Sansa has Arya execute him. Samwell arrives at Winterfell and meets with Bran, where both discuss Jon's parentage. They realise Jon is a trueborn Targaryen named Aegon and valid heir to the Iron Throne, with his parents—Rhaegar Targaryen and Lyanna Stark—having married in secret. At Eastwatch, an undead Viserion damages the Wall, allowing the Army of the Dead to march south.","descriptionEmpty":false,"displayOrder":707,"emptySerie":false,"fileName":"201712/s07e07 The Dragon and The Wolf.m4v","genre":{"displayOrder":2,"empty":false,"id":4,"name":"SF-Fantasy","pictureFileName":"sf.png"},"genreName":"SF-Fantasy","id":47000180,"language":{"displayOrder":3,"id":"cz","name":"Czech","none":false},"languageName":"Czech","name":"The Dragon and The Wolf","originalLanguage":{"displayOrder":1,"id":"en","name":"English","none":false},"originalLanguageName":"English","originalName":"The Dragon and The Wolf","pictureFileName":"s07e07 The Dragon and The Wolf.jpg","serie":{"displayOrder":1000,"empty":false,"genre":{"displayOrder":2,"empty":false,"id":4,"name":"SF-Fantasy","pictureFileName":"sf.png"},"genreName":"SF-Fantasy","id":1000,"name":"Game of Thrones","pictureFileName":"got.jpg","tvShow":true},"serieName":"Game of Thrones","subtitles":{"displayOrder":3,"id":"cz","name":"Czech","none":false},"subtitlesName":"Czech","url":"","urlEmpty":true,"urlFlag":"","year":2017}
