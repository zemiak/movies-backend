In the present, Tywin is buried and Lancel returns, now a devoutly religious man and a member of the \"Sparrows\". In Pentos, a despondent Tyrion agrees to accompany Varys to Meereen to support Targaryen's claim on the Iron Throne. In Meereen, the insurgent \"Sons of the Harpy\" murder an Unsullied, forcing Targaryen to launch more restrictive measures without respecting the old traditions. Missandei gets suspicious when she realizes that the Unsullied visit brothels. Targaryen's locked-away dragons attack her when she checks on them. In the Vale, Baelish puts Arryn in the care of House Royce and leaves with Sansa. At the Wall, Stannis seeks to enlist the Wildlings in his war against Roose. Snow is unable to convince Rayder to accept Stannis's authority. The latter has Mance burned alive, though Snow shoots him with an arrow to kill him quickly.","descriptionEmpty":false,"displayOrder":501,"emptySerie":false,"fileName":"201605/S05E01 The Wars to Come.m4v","genre":{"displayOrder":2,"empty":false,"id":4,"name":"SF-Fantasy","pictureFileName":"sf.png"},"genreName":"SF-Fantasy","id":42000147,"language":{"displayOrder":3,"id":"cz","name":"Czech","none":false},"languageName":"Czech","name":"The Wars to Come","originalLanguage":{"displayOrder":1,"id":"en","name":"English","none":false},"originalLanguageName":"English","originalName":"The Wars to Come","pictureFileName":"S05E01 The Wars to Come.jpg","serie":{"displayOrder":1000,"empty":false,"genre":{"displayOrder":2,"empty":false,"id":4,"name":"SF-Fantasy","pictureFileName":"sf.png"},"genreName":"SF-Fantasy","id":1000,"name":"Game of Thrones","pictureFileName":"got.jpg","tvShow":true},"serieName":"Game of Thrones","subtitles":{"displayOrder":3,"id":"cz","name":"Czech","none":false},"subtitlesName":"Czech","url":"http://www.csfd.cz/film/263138-hra-o-truny/417533-v-ocekavani-valek/","urlEmpty":false,"urlFlag":"CSFD","year":2015}
