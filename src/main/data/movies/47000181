Bran unemotionally bids farewell to Meera, divulging that he is no longer the boy she accompanied through the North. Littlefinger presents Bran with the dagger that was previously used in his attempted assassination. Cersei assures the Iron Bank a full return on their investment, as a train carrying gold from Highgarden is on its way to King's Landing. In a cave filled with dragonglass, Jon reveals ancient paintings to Daenerys depicting the First Men and the Children of the Forest joining forces against the undead. Later, Daenerys learns of the sacking of Highgarden by Lannister forces and realizes her attack on Casterly Rock was a distraction. Despite Tyrion's protests, she decides to take action. Led by Daenerys riding Drogon, the Dothraki cavalry catches the Lannister army by surprise and decimate or capture its remaining forces. Drogon is wounded during the fight by a spear fired from the scorpion ballista being manned by Bronn. Jaime mounts a desperate charge on horseback at a vulnerable Daenerys, but Drogon spews fire in time to thwart the attack. Bronn tackles Jaime into the river in time to save him.","descriptionEmpty":false,"displayOrder":704,"emptySerie":false,"fileName":"201712/s07e04 The Spoils of War.m4v","genre":{"displayOrder":2,"empty":false,"id":4,"name":"SF-Fantasy","pictureFileName":"sf.png"},"genreName":"SF-Fantasy","id":47000181,"language":{"displayOrder":3,"id":"cz","name":"Czech","none":false},"languageName":"Czech","name":"The Spoils of War","originalLanguage":{"displayOrder":1,"id":"en","name":"English","none":false},"originalLanguageName":"English","originalName":"The Spoils of War","pictureFileName":"s07e04 The Spoils of War.jpg","serie":{"displayOrder":1000,"empty":false,"genre":{"displayOrder":2,"empty":false,"id":4,"name":"SF-Fantasy","pictureFileName":"sf.png"},"genreName":"SF-Fantasy","id":1000,"name":"Game of Thrones","pictureFileName":"got.jpg","tvShow":true},"serieName":"Game of Thrones","subtitles":{"displayOrder":3,"id":"cz","name":"Czech","none":false},"subtitlesName":"Czech","url":"","urlEmpty":true,"urlFlag":"","year":2017}
