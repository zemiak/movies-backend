The White Walkers march toward the Wall, where Tollett allows Bran and Meera inside. At Winterfell, despite Sansa's disapproval, Jon secures the loyalties of Houses Umber and Karstark, who fought alongside Ramsay in the Battle of the Bastards. At the Citadel, Samwell steals books that reveal a large reservoir of dragonglass in Dragonstone, and sends word to Jon. He later finds Jorah in a cell. In the Riverlands, Arya meets a group of friendly Lannister soldiers, who take her intention to kill Cersei as a joke. Thoros shows Sandor a vision in the fire. The revelation leads him to believe in the Lord of Light. In King's Landing, Jaime tells Cersei of the crucial need for allies. She welcomes Euron, who proposes marriage to her in exchange for his Iron Fleet and a chance to kill Theon and Yara. Cersei declines citing trust as a concern, so Euron promises to return with a \"gift\" to prove his loyalty. Daenerys arrives at Dragonstone, the home of House Targaryen once occupied by Stannis, with her army and dragons.","descriptionEmpty":false,"displayOrder":701,"emptySerie":false,"fileName":"201712/s07e01 Dragonstone.m4v","genre":{"displayOrder":2,"empty":false,"id":4,"name":"SF-Fantasy","pictureFileName":"sf.png"},"genreName":"SF-Fantasy","id":47000198,"language":{"displayOrder":3,"id":"cz","name":"Czech","none":false},"languageName":"Czech","name":"Dragonstone","originalLanguage":{"displayOrder":1,"id":"en","name":"English","none":false},"originalLanguageName":"English","originalName":"Dragonstone","pictureFileName":"s07e01 Dragonstone.jpg","serie":{"displayOrder":1000,"empty":false,"genre":{"displayOrder":2,"empty":false,"id":4,"name":"SF-Fantasy","pictureFileName":"sf.png"},"genreName":"SF-Fantasy","id":1000,"name":"Game of Thrones","pictureFileName":"got.jpg","tvShow":true},"serieName":"Game of Thrones","subtitles":{"displayOrder":3,"id":"cz","name":"Czech","none":false},"subtitlesName":"Czech","url":"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5654088/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1","urlEmpty":false,"urlFlag":"IMDB","year":2017}
